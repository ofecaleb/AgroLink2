# AgroLink Super Admin Operation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for operating AgroLink's automated admin system as the sole Super Admin. The system is designed to minimize your workload using advanced algorithms, automation rules, and AI-powered decision-making while maintaining full control over critical operations.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Admin Automation Engine** - Handles automated decision-making and rule execution

3. **Audit Logging System** - Tracks all admin actions and automation decisions
4. **Notification System** - Alerts you to important events requiring attention
5. **Analytics Engine** - Provides insights and performance metrics

### Automation Levels
- **Fully Automated** - Rules execute without human intervention
- **Semi-Automated** - Rules suggest actions, require admin approval
- **Manual Override** - Admin can override any automated decision
- **Emergency Mode** - All automation disabled, manual control only

## Getting Started

npm run dev
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Super Admin Account
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Register a new account or use existing account
3. Update your user role to 'super_admin' in the database:

```sql

UPDATE users SET role = 'super_admin' WHERE id = USER_ID;
```

#### Step 3: Access Admin Dashboard
1. Log in with your super admin account
2. Navigate to `/admin` or click the admin dashboard link
3. You should see the green-themed Super Admin Dashboard
